## General info
In this project I tried to create a chat windows, where you can send messages, and also reply them.
More than that, I also played around with the themes changing, so that you can switch from one theme to another without refreshing the page and losing the messages from the chat.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript ES6

## Setup
To run this project, open the index.html file.
